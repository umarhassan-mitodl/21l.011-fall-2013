Each essay should be 5–7 double-spaced pages long, with one-inch margins. Be sure to describe and analyze specific scenes or images to support your argument.

These topic questions aim to help you to generate a focused, coherent essay. If you would like to write on another topic, you must _discuss it in advance_ with your TA.

*   How are new technologies portrayed in films we've seen this semester? You can look at specific scenes in _Modern Times, The General_, and "The Lonedale Operator." On a narrative and technical level what does the new technology / innovation allow the director to do? What is the director's attitude towards technological advances, and how does he express them? When, how, where, and why does the new technology appear? Are there particular characters associated with the technology, and is there significance to that association?
*   How do movies like "The Immigrant," "Easy Street," "A Beast at Bay," and _Modern Times_ depict social ills and what is the director's attitude toward these problems? Keep in mind that many early moviegoers lived in urban areas and were immigrants.
*   How does the progression of gender roles in silent era films embody and / or contradict the Fred Ott principle? How do the silent directors incorporate or confront the social roles and limitations of the times? You can use any of D.W. Griffith shorts and Keaton's films, and Chaplin's _Modern Times_, acknowledging that this film produced in the sound era can be considered a culminating text of the silent cinema.
*   Analyze Tom Gunning's theory of a "cinema of attractions" from his article "An Aesthetic of Astonishment" in relation to two or three early films. Does his claim work perfectly, or is there something you would add, modify, complicate, or disagree with?
*   Subjectivity in _The Last Laugh_. Choose two or three representative scenes from _The Last Laugh_ and discuss Murnau's strategies for dramatizing the inner lives of characters and the reality of their environments.
